'Tomorrow is the question' - a large abstract acryl painting on canvas with a lot of wild brush strokes in blue, red, and broken white. I painted this work in 2008 together with my artist friend Ben Vollers, as painter duo BenFo. It is one of the circa 50 large paintings we created like jamming, but with brushes and paint! Some call this fusion art. This free art image is suitable for making large art prints, posters or wallpapers - Colorful art image in free download by BenFo: Ben Vollers & Fons Heijnsbroek - Dutch abstract painter artists of The Netherlands. -->
